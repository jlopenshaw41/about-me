        <h2>About Me</h2>

        <p>My name is Jen and I'm an [aspiring] software developer. I am part of the September 2020 Software Engineering bootcamp cohort at <a href="https://www.manchestercodes.com/software-engineer-fasttrack/" target="_blank">Manchester Codes</a><br><br>I am a 'returner', making a career-shift into tech after three years raising a family</p>

        <h3>Work experience</h3>
        
        <p>I have over 10 years real-world experience in the heritage sector. I've managed historic houses open to the public, I've led teams of various shapes and sizes, I've overseen large projects and I've driven compliance across hundreds of National Trust places. Prior to that, I trained as a Graduate Analyst at Accenture IT Consultancy, spending most of my early career in the finance & banking sector. I have a history degree and a Masters in Heritage Management.</p>
